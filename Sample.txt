Subject: Regarding the Project Approval

Hi Michael,

As discussed earlier, if you can offer a small payoff or some form of kickback, 
I will push the approval through faster on our end.

This will remain secret between us. 
Please do not share this conversation with anyone else in the team.

Regards,
John

Subject: Non-public update ahead of the announcement

Hi,

Please keep this confidential.
The pricing strategy for Q4 will be changed based on the insider data we reviewed yesterday. 
This information is non-public until next Monday.

Make sure your team adjusts positions before the announcement.

Regards,
Sarah

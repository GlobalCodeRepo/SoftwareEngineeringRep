Subject: Regarding the Project Approval

Hi Michael,

As discussed earlier, if you can offer a small payoff or some form of kickback, 
I will push the approval through faster on our end.

This will remain secret between us. 
Please do not share this conversation with anyone else in the team.

Regards,
John

Subject: Non-public update ahead of the announcement

Hi,

Please keep this confidential.
The pricing strategy for Q4 will be changed based on the insider data we reviewed yesterday. 
This information is non-public until next Monday.

Make sure your team adjusts positions before the announcement.

Regards,
Sarah

Subject: Need your help on Q4 deal — keep this confidential

Hi,

Please keep this between us only. Do NOT share this with anyone inside or outside the team.  
The pricing strategy for Q4 will be changed based on the numbers we discussed yesterday.  
The formal announcement will come next week, but the internal committee has already decided.  
This is **non-public information** for now.

If you can quietly push your clients to **buy heavily today before the update**,  
you’ll benefit once the new price floor becomes public.  
We need to **position ourselves before the market reacts**.

As we agreed earlier, I can **make sure your approval request gets fast-tracked**  
if you can “help us out” by prioritizing the orders from our preferred list.  
Let’s consider this a friendly **gesture**, not part of the formal process.

Also, please **stop using the company email for this conversation**;  
switch to the private WhatsApp number I shared yesterday.  
We shouldn't leave an official trail for these adjustments.

On another note, I’ve already raised concerns to HR that the operations team  
has been **ignoring escalation protocols** and blaming us for delays.  
Honestly, the way they handled the last compliance query was unprofessional.  
We should document these behaviors and escalate if needed.

Let me know once the orders are placed.  
Delete this email after reading.

Regards,  
Michael
